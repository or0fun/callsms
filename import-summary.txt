ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .gitignore
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard/
* proguard/dump.txt
* proguard/mapping.txt
* proguard/seeds.txt
* proguard/usage.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => callsms/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => callsms/src/main/assets/
* libs/Msc.jar => callsms/libs/Msc.jar
* libs/android-support-v13.jar => callsms/libs/android-support-v13.jar
* libs/armeabi/libmsc.so => callsms/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libmsc.so
* proguard-project.txt => callsms/proguard-project.txt
* res/ => callsms/src/main/res/
* src/ => callsms/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
